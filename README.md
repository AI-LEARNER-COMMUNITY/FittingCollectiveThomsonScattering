Fitting Thomson Scattering Spectra**:   Thomson scattering diagnostics record a scattered power spectrum that encodes information about the electron and ion density, temperatures, and flow velocities. This information can be retrieved by fitting the measured spectrum with the theoretical spectral density (spectral_density).
